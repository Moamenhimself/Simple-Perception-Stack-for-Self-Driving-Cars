# Simple-Perception-Stack-for-Self-Driving-Cars
In this project we're going to create a simple perception stack for SDCs. We're only focusing on video streams from cameras for simplicity. Weâ€™re mainly going to be analyzing the road ahead, detecting the lane lines, detecting other cars/agents on the road, and estimating some useful information that may help other SDCs stacks. The project is split into two phases.
Phase 1- Lane Line Detection:
